  - Final project for CS439 to identify the efficacy of transfer learning in sentiment analysis
  - Conducted literature review of sentiment analysis, learning about lexicons, Naive Bayes, parts-of-speech tagging, aspect-based sentiment analysis, sentence + document sentence-level sentiment analysis
  - Scraped data from review platforms (Steam, IMDB, Metacritic) and fine-tuned the BERT models to predict review ratings from text
  - Compared performance of the generalist model trained on all data against specialized models trained solely on each platform in a 7-page Latex report
